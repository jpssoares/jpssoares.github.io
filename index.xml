      <description>What have I been up to? This past month has been a lot of work. Having done tests on all my different classes and also many different team projects, I can say that November has been tough. Despite all I said, I think that this year has been the least stressful of my 3-year journey at university. I think I have adapted quite well to this lifestyle, and if I keep my pace, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll do fine.</description>

      <description>What have I been up to? I decided to start this new project where I write about all the cool stuff that happened each week. I will try to post one of these everyweek, starting now (last week of October 2021).
To help achieve this, I created a python script that automaticly create a post with some template text.
import datetime import calendar import os def getSundayDate(weekday, date): switcher = { &amp;#34;Monday&amp;#34;: 1, &amp;#34;Tuesday&amp;#34;: 2, &amp;#34;Wednesday&amp;#34;: 3, &amp;#34;Thursday&amp;#34;: 4, &amp;#34;Friday&amp;#34;: 5, &amp;#34;Saturday&amp;#34;: 6, &amp;#34;Sunday&amp;#34;: 0 } difference = switcher.</description>
