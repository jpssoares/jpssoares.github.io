      <description>What have I been up to? This past month has been a lot of work. Having done tests on all my different classes and also many different team projects, I can say that November has been tough. Despite all I said, I think that this year has been the least stressful of my 3-year journey at university. I think I have adapted quite well to this lifestyle, and if I keep my pace, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll do fine.</description>
